# Ingenious
Project Ingenious helps instructors and students not only make education interactive but also to make it fun to learn for both of them. Instructors and students can use 3-dimensional AR models of complex objects like atoms to cosmos so that they can interact and play with it in virtual space just to learn more intricate details about it.
